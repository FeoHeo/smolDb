***There will 2 ends in a web-database architecture, front-end and back-end

** Front-end 
    - Tokenizer
    - Parser
    - Code generator

** Back-end 
    - Virtual machine
    - B-tree 
    - Pager 
    - OS-interface


- Tokenizer: 'Bison' is the tokenizer used for SQLite. Won't build a tokenizer by myself cause it is quite simple. Many think of tokenizer as complex compilers
but in its simpliest for, a tokenizer is kinda like a calculator. <variable> would be the input numbers with <operators> tokens being [+,-,*,/].
    + Sadly, knowing this won't make learning how use Bison easier :<
